# CryptoClustering

In this repository, you will find the Resources folder which contains the original .csv file used for the data analysis. Then there is the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb file, the Jupyter Notebook that has the dataframes, graphs, results, and analysis. I consulted AskBCS for this assignment as well as the TAs. Please let me know if there are any outstanding issues with the work. Thank you for your consideration.

Best,
Andrew
